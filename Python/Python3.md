# 3 Methods To Install Latest Python3 Package On CentOS 6 System

BY [PRAKASH SUBRAMANIAN](https://www.2daygeek.com/author/prakash/) · PUBLISHED : MAY 9, 2018 || LAST UPDATED: MAY 9, 2018





CentOS is RHEL clone and comes with free of cost. It’s a industry standard and cutting edge operating system, this has been used by 90% of webhosting provider since it’s supporting the leading edge server control panel called cPanel/WHM.

This control panel allowing users to manage everything through control panel without entering into terminal.

As we already know that RHEL has long term support and doesn’t offer the latest version of packages due to stability.

If you want to install latest version of packages, which is not available in the default repository and you have to install manually by compiling the source package.

It’s a high risk because we can’t upgrade the manually installed packages to latest version if they release new version and we have to reinstall manually.

In this case what will be the solution and suggested method to install latest version of package? Yes, this can be done by adding the necessary third party repository to system.

There are many third party repositories are available for Enterprise Linux but only few of repositories are suggested to use by CentOS communicant, which doesn’t alter the base packages in large scale.



They are usually well maintained and provide a substantial number of additional packages to CentOS.

In this tutorial, we will teach you, how to install latest Python 3 package on CentOS 6 system.

#### Method-1 : Using Software Collections Repository (SCL)

The SCL repository is now maintained by a CentOS SIG, which rebuilds the Red Hat Software Collections and also provides some additional packages of their own.

It contains newer versions of various programs that can be installed alongside existing older packages and invoked by using the scl command.

Run the following command to install Software Collections Repository on CentOS

```
# yum install centos-release-scl
```

Check the available python 3 version.



```
# yum info rh-python35
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, security
Loading mirror speeds from cached hostfile
 * epel: ewr.edge.kernel.org
 * remi-safe: mirror.team-cymru.com
Available Packages
Name        : rh-python35
Arch        : x86_64
Version     : 2.0
Release     : 2.el6
Size        : 0.0
Repo        : installed
From repo   : centos-sclo-rh
Summary     : Package that installs rh-python35
License     : GPLv2+
Description : This is the main package for rh-python35 Software Collection.
```

Run the below command to install latest available python 3 package from scl.

```
# yum install rh-python35
```

Run the below special scl command to enable the installed package version at the shell.

```
# scl enable rh-python35 bash
```

Run the below command to check installed python3 version.

```
# python --version
Python 3.5.1
```

Run the following command to get a list of SCL packages have been installed on system.

```
# scl -l
rh-python35
```

#### Method-2 : Using EPEL Repository (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux)

EPEL stands for Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux maintained by Fedora Special Interest Group.

They creates, maintains, and manages a high quality set of additional packages for Enterprise Linux, including, but not limited to, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS and Scientific Linux (SL), Oracle Linux (OL).

EPEL packages are usually based on their Fedora counterparts and will never conflict with or replace packages in the base Enterprise Linux distributions.

**Suggested Read :** [Install / Enable EPEL Repository on RHEL, CentOS, Oracle Linux & Scientific Linux](https://www.2daygeek.com/install-enable-epel-repository-on-rhel-centos-scientific-linux-oracle-linux/)

EPEL package is included in the CentOS Extras repository and enabled by default so, we can install this by running below command.

```
# yum install epel-release
```

Check the available python 3 version.

```
# yum --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo="epel" info python34
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, security
Loading mirror speeds from cached hostfile
 * epel: ewr.edge.kernel.org
Available Packages
Name        : python34
Arch        : x86_64
Version     : 3.4.5
Release     : 4.el6
Size        : 50 k
Repo        : epel
Summary     : Version 3 of the Python programming language aka Python 3000
URL         : http://www.python.org/
License     : Python
Description : Python 3 is a new version of the language that is incompatible with the 2.x
            : line of releases. The language is mostly the same, but many details, especially
            : how built-in objects like dictionaries and strings work, have changed
            : considerably, and a lot of deprecated features have finally been removed.
```

Run the below command to install latest available python 3 package from EPEL repository.

```
# yum --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo="epel" install python34
```

By default this will not install matching pip & setuptools and we have to install by running below command.

```
# curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

```

#### Method-3 : Using IUS Community Repository

IUS Community is a CentOS Community Approved third-party RPM repository which contains latest upstream versions of PHP, Python, MySQL, etc.., packages for Enterprise Linux (RHEL & CentOS) 5, 6 & 7.

IUS Community Repository have dependency with EPEL Repository so we have to install EPEL repository prior to IUS repository installation. Follow the below steps to install & enable EPEL & IUS Community Repository to RPM systems and install the packages.

**Suggested Read :** [Install / Enable IUS Community Repository on RHEL & CentOS](https://www.2daygeek.com/install-enable-ius-community-repository-on-rhel-centos/)

EPEL package is included in the CentOS Extras repository and enabled by default so, we can install this by running below command.

```
# yum install epel-release
```

### Python 3.7

#### Step 1 – Requirements

This Python installation required the GCC compiler on your system. Login to your server using ssh or shell access. Now, use the following command to install prerequisites for Python before installing it.

- Read: [How to Use SSH to Connect Remote Linux Server](https://tecadmin.net/use-ssh-connect-remote-linux-server/)

```shell
yum install -y zlib-devel bzip2-devel openssl-devel ncurses-devel sqlite-devel 
readline-devel tk-devel gdbm-devel db4-devel libpcap-devel xz-devel
```

#### Step 2 – Download Python 3.7

Download Python using the following command from the Python official site. You can also download the latest version in place of specified below.

```shell
cd /usr/src
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.9/Python-3.7.9.tgz
```

Now extract the downloaded package.

```shell
tar xzf Python-3.7.9.tgz
```

#### Step 3 – Install Python 3.7

Use below set of commands to compile Python source code on your system using altinstall.

```shell
cd Python-3.7.9
./configure --enable-optimizations
make altinstall
```

**make altinstall** is used to prevent replacing the default python binary file **/usr/bin/python**.

Now remove downloaded source archive file from your system

```shell
rm /usr/src/Python-3.7.9.tgz
```

#### Step 4 – Check Python Version

Check the latest version installed of python. Use command python3.7 instead of just python.

```shell
python3.7 -V

Python 3.7.9
```
