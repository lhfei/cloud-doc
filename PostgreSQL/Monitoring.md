# Queries to monitor your PostgreSQL database

These have been compiled from multiple sources like the [postgresql wiki](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Main_Page), and [check_postgres](https://bucardo.org/wiki/Check_postgres).

## Usage
These `PREPARE`d statements are essentially queries with names (and 0 arguments) for convenience. Once you have executed a `PREPARE`, you can run it using `EXECUTE` like so:

```sql
EXECUTE query_stats;
```

You can either copy/paste these in selectively, or use the [full list of queries](./monitor.sql).

## Cost
These queries can be run periodically to send data to your monitoring system. They are all cheap enough to be run every few seconds even during heavy load.


## Queries
### current_queries_status (pg9.x)
```sql
PREPARE current_queries_status AS
SELECT count(pid), query, waiting from pg_stat_activity group by query, waiting;
```

### current_queries_status_with_locks (pg9.x)
```sql
PREPARE current_queries_status_with_locks AS
SELECT count(pg_stat_activity.pid) AS number_of_queries,
       substring(trim(LEADING
                      FROM regexp_replace(pg_stat_activity.query, '[\n\r]+'::text,
                       ' '::text, 'g'::text))
                 FROM 0
                 FOR 200) AS query_name,
       max(age(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, query_start)) AS max_wait_time,
       waiting,
       usename,
       locktype,
       mode,
       granted
  FROM pg_stat_activity
  LEFT JOIN pg_locks ON pg_stat_activity.pid = pg_locks.pid
  WHERE query != '<IDLE>'
    AND query NOT ILIKE '%pg_%' AND query NOT ILIKE '%application_name%' AND query NOT ILIKE '%inet%'
    AND age(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, query_start) > '5 milliseconds'::interval
  GROUP BY query_name,
           waiting,
           usename,
           locktype,
           mode,
           granted
  ORDER BY max_wait_time DESC;
```

### current_queries_status_with_locks (pg10)
```sql
PREPARE current_queries_status_with_locks AS
SELECT count(pg_stat_activity.pid) AS number_of_queries,
       substring(trim(LEADING
                      FROM regexp_replace(pg_stat_activity.query, '[\n\r]+'::text,
                       ' '::text, 'g'::text))
                 FROM 0
                 FOR 200) AS query_name,
       max(age(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, query_start)) AS max_wait_time,
       wait_event,
       usename,
       locktype,
       mode,
       granted
  FROM pg_stat_activity
  LEFT JOIN pg_locks ON pg_stat_activity.pid = pg_locks.pid
  WHERE query != '<IDLE>'
    AND query NOT ILIKE '%pg_%' AND query NOT ILIKE '%application_name%' AND query NOT ILIKE '%inet%'
    AND age(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, query_start) > '5 milliseconds'::interval
  GROUP BY query_name,
           wait_event,
           usename,
           locktype,
           mode,
           granted
  ORDER BY max_wait_time DESC;
```

### query_stats
```sql
PREPARE query_stats AS
SELECT LEFT(query,50) AS query,
       calls, total_time, rows, shared_blks_hit,
       local_blks_hit, blk_read_time, blk_write_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE EXISTS(SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions
             WHERE name = 'pg_stat_statements')
ORDER BY calls DESC;
```

- This requires [pg_stat_statements](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/pgstatstatements.html) to be set up. It's a part of the contrib package, and needs to be added to `shared_preload_libraries` in `postgresql.conf`.

## Cache
### cache_tables
```sql
PREPARE cache_tables AS
SELECT relname AS "relation",
       heap_blks_read AS heap_read,
       heap_blks_hit AS heap_hit,
       ( (heap_blks_hit*100) / NULLIF((heap_blks_hit + heap_blks_read), 0)) AS ratio
FROM pg_statio_user_tables;
```

### cache_total
```sql
PREPARE cache_total AS
SELECT sum(heap_blks_read) AS heap_read,
       sum(heap_blks_hit)  AS heap_hit,
       (sum(heap_blks_hit)*100 / NULLIF((sum(heap_blks_hit) + sum(heap_blks_read)),0)) AS ratio
FROM pg_statio_user_tables;
```

## Disk usage
### table_sizes
```sql
PREPARE table_sizes AS
SELECT relname AS "relation",
       pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(C.oid)) AS "total_size"
FROM pg_class C
LEFT JOIN pg_namespace N ON (N.oid = C.relnamespace)
WHERE nspname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema')
      AND C.relkind <> 'i'
      AND nspname ='public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(C.oid) DESC;
```

### relation_sizes
```sql
PREPARE relation_sizes AS
SELECT relname AS "relation",
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(C.oid)) AS "size"
FROM pg_class C
LEFT JOIN pg_namespace N ON (N.oid = C.relnamespace)
WHERE nspname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(C.oid) DESC;
```

### db_size
```sql
PREPARE db_size AS
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database()));
```

## Bloat
### table_bloat
```sql
PREPARE table_bloat AS
