## Properties for the User Object



This page explains the common LDAP attributes which are used in VBS scripts and PowerShell.  Programs like VBScript (WSH), CSVDE and LDIFDE rely on these LDAP attributes to create or modify objects in Active Directory.  For example, when you bulk import users you will include the LDAP attributes: dn and sAMAccountName.

\* LDAP is the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.

### [Hall of Fame LDAP Attribute - DN  Distinguished Name]()

As the word 'distinguished' suggests, this is THE LDAP attribute that uniquely defines an object.  Each DN must have a different name and location from all other objects in Active Directory.  The other side of the coin is that DN provides a way of selecting any object in Active Directory.  Once you have selected the object, then you can change its attributes.

Time spent in getting to know the DN attribute will repay many fold.  Observe the different components CN=common name, OU = organizational unit.  DC often comes with two entries, DC=CP, DC=COM.  Note that DC=CP.COM would be wrong.  Incidentally in this situation, DC means domain content rather than domain controller.

Another point with the syntax is to check the speech marks; when used with VBScript commands, DN is often enclosed in "speech marks".  Even the speech marks have to be of the right type, "double quotes are correct", 'single quotes may be ignored', with unpredictable results.  Finally, pay particular attention to commas in distinguished names.

### [LDAP Attributes from Active Directory Users and Computers]()

The diagram below is taken from Active Directory Users and Computers. It shows the commonest LDAP attributes for vbs scripts.

[![LDAP Attributes for CSVDE](http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/images/code/ldap_properties.jpg)](http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/w2k3/utilities/adsi_edit.htm)

When you write your scripts, check how the LDAP attributes map to the Active Directory boxes.

**Research Tip:**
One of my favourite techniques is to add values in the active directory property boxes, then export using CSVDE.  Next, open the .csv file in Excel, search for the value, and read the LDAP field name from row 1.

| [LDAP Attribute]()                       | Example                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| C                                        | Country: e.g GB for Great Britain.       |
| CN - Common Name                         | CN=Guy Thomas.  Actually, this LDAP attribute can be made up from givenName joined to SN. |
| CN                                       | Maps to 'Name' in the LDAP provider. Remember CN is a mandatory property.  See also sAMAccountName. |
| description                              | What you see in Active Directory Users and Computers.  Not to be confused with displayName on the Users property sheet. |
| displayName                              | displayName = Guy Thomas.  If you script this property, be sure you understand which field you are configuring.  DisplayName can be confused with CN or description. |

| DN - also distinguishedName              | DN is simply the most important LDAP attribute.CN=Jay Jamieson, OU= Newport,DC=cp,DC=com |
| givenName                                | Firstname also called Christian name     |
| homeDrive                                | Home Folder : connect.  Tricky to configure |
| initials                                 | Useful in some cultures.                 |
| name                                     | name = Guy Thomas.  Exactly the same as CN. |
| objectCategory                           | Defines the Active Directory Schema category. For example, objectCategory = Person |
| objectClass                              | objectClass = User.  Also used for Computer, organizationalUnit, even container.  Important top level container. |
| physicalDeliveryOfficeName               | Office! on the user's General property sheet |
| postOfficeBox                            | P.O. box.                                |
| profilePath                              | Roaming profile path: connect.  Trick to set up |
| sAMAccountName                           | This is a mandatory property, sAMAccountName = guyt.  The old NT 4.0 logon name, must be unique in the domain. |
| sAMAccountName                           | If you are using an LDAP provider 'Name' automatically maps to sAMAcountName and CN. The default value is same as CN, but can be given a different value. |
| SN                                       | SN = Thomas. This would be referred to as last name or surname. |
| title                                    | Job title.  For example Manager.         |
| userAccountControl                       | Used to disable an account.  A value of 514 disables the account, while 512 makes the account ready for logon. |
| userPrincipalName                        | userPrincipalName = guyt@CP.com  Often abbreviated to UPN, and looks like an email address.  Very useful for logging on especially in a large Forest.  Note UPN must be unique in the forest. |
| wWWHomePage                              | User's home page.                        |

| mAPIRecipient - FALSE                    | Indicates that a contact is not a domain user. |
| mailNickname                             | Normally this is the same value as the sAMAccountName, but could be different if you wished.  Needed for mail enabled contacts. |

| msExchHomeServerName                     | Exchange needs to know which server to deliver the mail.  Example: /o=YourOrg/ou=First Administrative Group/cn=Configuration/cn=Servers/cn=MailSrv |
| proxyAddresses                           | As the name 'proxy' suggests, it is possible for one recipient to have more than one email address.  Note the plural spelling of proxyAddresses. |
| targetAddress                            | SMTP:@ e-mail address.  Note that SMTP is case sensitive.  All capitals means the default address. |
